struct Rectangle
{
   int length;
   int breath;
};

int main()
{
  struct Rectangle r = {10,5};
  struct Ractangle *p=&r;
  r.length = 15; //right
  p.length = 15; //wrong because pointer cannot access directly a data variable because it is a address variable
  (*p).lenght = 15; //to accesing data variable we cann use it. here () is must because first executes . and then *
  p -> length = 15 // also , acually it is simple

here is one more solution of it..
int main()
{
   p = (struct Rectangle *)malloc(sizeof(struct Rectangle)); //in c
   p = new struct Rectanle[sizeof(struct Rectangle)]; //in c++ maybe
   p->length = 15;
   p->length = 10;
