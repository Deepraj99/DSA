Pointers is a adress variable that is use for storing adress of data not data itself, normal variables are data variables but pointer is a adress variable.
pointers are useful for - 
accesing heep, resorses and passing parameters.

#include<bits/stdc++.h> or #include<malloc>  //C++
#include<stdlib.h> //C
int main()
{
   int *P;   //address variable or pointer   , int a; is a data variable
 
   p = (int *)malloc(5*sizeof(int)); // for C , it uses for alloting memory in heep
                                     // (int *) if for you are going to stroe int data and 5*sizeof(int) for 5 int values.

   p = new int[5];  // in C++ instead of malloc
}

Reference - usefull for parameters passing--
int main()
{
   int a = 10;
   int &r = a;    //now variable a has a another name r also, here a=10 & r=10
   cout<<a; //10  //adress of both a and r are same..
   r++;
   cout<<a; //11;
   cout<<r; //11;
